Sierra Barone Lima is the creator of the T-REX analysis pipeline, and original author of the code. 

Jonathan Irish is conceptualized the pipeline with Sierra, oversaw project development, 
and contributed to the original code. 

Cass Mayeda refactored the pipeline, integrated contributions from Claire Cross
and Hannah Thirman, and made minor useability improvements.  

Claire Cross developed a new method for binning that made T-REX analysis identical in 
the case the files are switched. 

Hannah Thirman contributed code to color the plot titles blue and red
to match the identified populations.

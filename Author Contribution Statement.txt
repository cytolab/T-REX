Sierra Barone Lima is the creator of the T-REX analysis pipeline, 
and original author of the code. 

Jonathan Irish conceptualized the pipeline with Sierra, oversaw 
project development, and contributed to the original code. 

Cass Mayeda refactored the pipeline, integrated contributions from Claire 
Cross and Hannah Thirman, and made minor useability improvements.  

Claire Cross developed a new method for binning that made T-REX 
analysis identical in the case the file order is switched. 

Hannah Thirman contributed code to color the plot titles blue 
and red to match the identified populations.
